        <div class="grid-item">If you are forced to guess, make the guess which has the least risk.</div>
        <div class="grid-item">If you are forced to guess, make a guess that will actually help you if it turns out to be right.</div>
        <div class="grid-item">Don't just choose the first valid move you notice, choose the best move available.</div>
        <div class="grid-item">Avoid the walls until you have eaten out the center of the map.</div>
        <div class="grid-item">Imagine and already be planning for the states which could result from your current move.</div>
        <div class="grid-item">Your best chance of finding an opening on the first move is in a corner, then on an edge, then in the middle.</div>
        <div class="grid-item">If you don't know all the moves, then trying to go faster actually makes you worse. So go slow.</div>
        <div class="grid-item">You should play slower until you notice the number of mistakes you make go down.</div>
        <div class="grid-item">Always start from the same position.</div>
